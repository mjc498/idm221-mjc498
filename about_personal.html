    <p><b>Personal</b></p>
    <p>I own two loving cats named Cal and Boots. They are both three years old. My family adopted these two loving brothers 
        from a farm that my sister's friend owns. From stray barn kittens to domesticated house life, my cats have never failed to not
        entertain me from their silliness. Since I visit home about once a month, my tolerance for cats has gone down and I seem to have
        developed an allergy to dander! With the help of super strong allergy medication, nothing can stop me from using my cats as furry fluffy
        pillows to cuddle at night.</p>

    <p>Born and raised in Northeast Philadelphia in a first generation immigrant home, I have been surrounded by flavors of all sorts.
        I love exploring the city and trying different foods at different places. I avidly live by never ordering the same dish twice in a row.
