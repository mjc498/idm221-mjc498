        I share my home with two affectionate feline companions, Cal and Boots, both of whom are
        three years old. We welcomed these loving brothers into our family after adopting them 
        from a farm owned by my sister's friend.Transitioning from stray barn kittens to cherished
        members of our domestic life, their antics never fail to bring joy and amusement into 
        my daily routine.

        Despite my monthly visits home, I've noticed a decline in my tolerance for dander. 
        Armed with allergy medication, nothing can deter me from indulging in the comforting
        embrace of my cats, using them as delightful fluffy pillows for nighttime cuddles.

        Born and raised in Northeast Philadelphia in a first generation immigrant household,
        I have been immersed in a tapestry of diverse flavors. I love exploring the city and 
        trying a multitude of dishes from various locales. I avidly live by the principle of 
        never eating the same dish twice in a row to ensure each outing is a unique and 
        delectable journey.
