**Professional**

I am an undergraduate student at Drexel University with a love for creativity, the mind, and human behavior through technology. I am currently a User Experience & Interface Design (UXID) major with a minor in Psychology. 
Drexel University requires students to participate in a 6-month cooperation education program known as “Co-Op”. It creates opportunities for students like myself to gain professional work experience in International, Research, or Entrepreneurship settings. I will be available to work for my next Co-Op cycle in April of 2024 to August of 2024. 

**Personal**

*My Story...*

I found out about Drexel’s User Experience and Interactive Design program during my first co-op at Comcast Corporation when I used to be a psychology major. In the Comcast Technology Center, there is an exhibition called The Universal Sphere where the public can go through a fun and interactive cinematic experience. I was told that UXID co-ops helped work on this exhibit and wanted to know more. After extensive research and talking to many staff at the Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts and Design, I took a gap semester and officially changed my major. 
I am a first generation college student, born and raised in Northeast Philadelphia! I grew up in a Chinese-Filipino household as the middle child. 
Outside of my academic and professional life, I pursue many hobbies such as painting, reading, taking pictures, enjoying nature, and exploring the city of Philadelphia! I’m also a huge foodie and love to try new foods.
