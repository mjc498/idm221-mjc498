**Professional**

I am an undergraduate student at Drexel University with a love for creativity, the mind, and human behavior through technology. I am currently a User Experience & Interaction Design (UXID) major with a minor in Psychology. 
Drexel University requires students to participate in a 6-month cooperation education program known as “Co-Op”. It creates opportunities for students like myself to gain professional work experience in international, research, or entrepreneurship settings. I will be available to work for my next co-op cycle in April of 2024 to August of 2024. 

**Personal**

I found out about Drexel’s User Experience and Interactive Design program during my first co-op at Comcast Corporation when I used to be a psychology major. In the Comcast Technology Center, there is an exhibition called *The Universal Sphere* where the public can go through a fun and interactive cinematic experience. I was told that UXID co-ops helped work on this exhibit and wanted to know more. After extensive research and talking to many staff at the Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts and Design, I took a gap semester and officially changed my major. 


Outside of my academic and professional life, I pursue many hobbies such as painting, reading, taking pictures, enjoying nature, and exploring the city of Philadelphia! I am also a huge foodie and love to try new things.
