<h2 id="about me">ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p><b>Professional</b></p>
    <p>I am an undergraduate student at Drexel University with a love for creativity, the mind, and human behavior through technology. 
        I am currently a User Experience & Interactive Design (UXID) major with a minor in Psychology.</p>
    <p>Drexel University requires students to participate in a 6-month cooperation education oprogram known as "Co-Op".
        It creates opportunities for students like myself to gain professional work experience in international, research, or entrepreneurship settings.
        I will be available to work for my next co-op cycle in April of 2024 to August of 2024.</p>
    <br />
    <p><b>Personal</b></p>
    <p>I found out about Drexel's User Experience and Interactive Design program during my first co-op at Comcast Corporation
        when I used to be a psychology major. In the Comcast Technology Center, there is an exhibition called
        <i>The Universal Sphere</i> where the public can go through a fun and interactive cinematic experience.
        I was told that UXID co-ops helped work on this exhibit and wanted to know more. 
        After extensive research and talking to many staff at the Antoinette Westphal College of Media Arts and Design,
        I took a gap semester and officially changed my major.</p>
    <p>Outside of my academic and professional life, I pursue many hobbies such as painting, reading, taking pictures, 
        enjoying nature, and exploring the city of Philadelphia! I am also a huge foodie and love to try new things.</p>
