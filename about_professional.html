    <p>
        I am an undergraduate student at Drexel University, driven by a passion for creativity,
        the intricacies of the mind, and understanding human behavior through the lens of 
        technology. I am a second-year User Experience & Interactive Design (UXID) major
        with a minor in Psychology.
    </p>
    <p>
        My introduction to Drexel's UXID program occurred during my initial co-op at Comcast 
        Corporation,back when I was pursuing a Psychology major. While working at the Comcast 
        Technology Center, I encountered <i>The Universal Sphere</i> exhibition-- 
        an engaging and interactive cinematic experience open to the public. Learning that UXID
        co-op students contributed to this innovative exhibit, I was intrigued and sought further
        information. Following thorough research and conversations with faculty at the Antoinette
        Westphal College of Media Arts and Design, I made the decision to take a gap semester and 
        officially transitioned into my new major.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Drexel University mandates participation in the Co-Op program, a 6-month cooperative
        education initiative offering students like myself invaluable professional work experience
        in diverse settings, including international, research, and entrepreneurial environments.
        I will be available for the next co-op cycle from April 2024 to September 2024. I am eager
        to continue my journey of growth and exploration in the field.

    <p>
      Embracing and honoring culture held profound significance during my co-op with the Diversity,
      Equity, and Inclusion Department at Comcast Corporation. Among the events we helped organize
      and participated in, the above photo stood out to me as a personal favorite. As someone of
      half Chinese descent, witnessing a vibrant and inclusive community within the typically formal
      corporate environment was a deeply meaningful and heartwarming experience.
