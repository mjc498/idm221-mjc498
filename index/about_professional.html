    <h1 id="about me">ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p><b>Professional</b></p>
    <p>I am an undergraduate student at Drexel University with a love for creativity, the mind, and human behavior through technology. 
        I am currently a User Experience & Interactive Design (UXID) major with a minor in Psychology.</p>
    <p>Drexel University requires students to participate in a 6-month cooperation education oprogram known as "Co-Op".
        It creates opportunities for students like myself to gain professional work experience in international, research, or entrepreneurship settings.
        I will be available to work for my next co-op cycle in April of 2024 to August of 2024.</p>
